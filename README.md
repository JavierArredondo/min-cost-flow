# Min Cost Flow with an Instance generated by NETGEN

## Software and libraries

- Programming language: R
- IDE: Jupyter-notebook or Rstudio

### Installation of environment using [conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/) or [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

For create environment:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

After that activate env:

```
conda activate r-env
```

### Getting data

The problem to solve is about min cost flow in a network. Data for this problem is [here](http://elib.zib.de/pub/mp-testdata/mincost/netg/index.html). 

> Files *.net contain instances of the minimum cost flow problem generated by NETGEN or just the NETGEN parameters for generation, see D. Klingman, A. Napier, and J. Stutz: NETGEN: A program for generating large scale capacitated assignment, transportation, and minimum cost flow networks, Management Science 20 (1974), pp. 814-820, non-standard problems contributed by A. LÃ¶bel.


Details:

```bash
 Nodes are assumed to be numbered 1 to n, arcs are specified
 by pairs of head and tail nodes.

 Descriptor items:

   c <some text>   - comment line

   p min <nodes> <arcs>  - problem line, 

         appears before any node and arc descriptor line,

     <nodes> - number of nodes 
     <arcs>  - number of arcs 

   n <id> <flow> - node descriptor line,

          appears before any arc descriptor line,

     <id> - node identification number
     <flow> - node flow value

   a <v> <w> <low> <cap> <cost> - arc descriptor line,

     <v>    - identification number of tail node
     <w>    - identification number of head node
     <low>  - lower bound for <cap>
     <cap>  - capacity of arc, uncapacitated if <cap> < 0.
     <cost> - cost of arc
```

You can download and access to data following the next instructions:

```bash
wget http://elib.zib.de/pub/mp-testdata/mincost/netg.tar.gz
tar -xvf netg.tar.gz
```

**Note** *.gitignore* ignore `tar.gz` and `.net` files. Also ignore `netg/` directory (generated after extract `tar.gz`)


### For develop
With conda environment you can use Rstudio and Jupyter-notebook (both share libraries in r-env).
```bash
rstudio # For init Rstudio
jupyter-notebook # For run jupyter env
```
